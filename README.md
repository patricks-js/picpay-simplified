Each user has a wallet for transactions. The system ensures security, validation, and reliability during all financial operations.

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** TypeScript
- **Framework:** Fastify
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI
